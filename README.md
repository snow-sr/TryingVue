# TryingVue

What to say? I always had been a ReactBoy, but, looking for new experiences, I'm trying to use Vue.js.

### First impressions:
Quite easy to understand, a little bit messy when coding without caution.

I liked it? Yes, but I can't throw away all my react.js vices (and I can't abandon React too! I really love it). 
A good example of that would be the way that we hide/show things, with vue, we use v-if and v-else, with react we use ternary operations between brackets, and lot of other stuff.

well, i'm really liking it, it's a lot more simple than react.
